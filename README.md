# hostsFileUpdate-
updates your hosts file to get past the WMG/SME blocks in deep-cut.fm
Download the .zip file and execute the .exe file contained with elevate windows rights, right click the .exe and "run as administrator" to complete the alterations.
The application backs up your C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file, adds a new line if one does not exist, or replaces the current entry in effort to spoof the YouTube servers, getting past the WMG/SME blocks.
A shortcut will be placed on your desktop and the new domain will be copied to your windows clipboard, ready for paste, after application execution.
Extensions will no longer work with this DNS domain alteration but bookmarklets will work as long as the URL has not had to be changed. If it needs to be changed, bookmarklets just need configured after domain change.
